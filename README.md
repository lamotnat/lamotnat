Hi! I'm @lamotnat
I'm a Computer Science Engineering Major and Linguistics Minor at The Ohio State University! 
I'm interested in embedded software as well as high-level applications such as natural language processing.
Outside of CSE I'm self-teaching Japanese, enjoy board games, and listen to a number of podcasts.

Thanks for checking out my page :D
